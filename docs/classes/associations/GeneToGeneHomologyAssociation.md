# Class: GeneToGeneHomologyAssociation


A homology association between two genes. May be orthology (in which case the species of subject and object should differ) or paralogy (in which case the species may be the same)

## Attributes


### Own

 * [gene to gene homology association➞relation](gene_to_gene_homology_association_relation.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: homology relationship type
    * range: [Uriorcurie](types/Uriorcurie.md)

### Inherited from association:

 * [association➞id](association_id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for an association
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [association type](association_type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the type of association (e.g. gene to phenotype)
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
 * [subject](subject.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the subject of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [predicate](predicate.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes.
    * range: [PredicateType](types/PredicateType.md)
 * [object](object.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
    * range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
 * [relation](relation.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: The relation which describes an association between a subject and an object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology, but it can be any edge CURIE.
    * range: [Uriorcurie](types/Uriorcurie.md)
 * [negated](negated.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true
    * range: [Boolean](types/Boolean.md)
 * [qualifiers](qualifiers.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association
    * range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
 * [publications](publications.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to publications supporting the association
    * range: [Publication](Publication.md)
 * [provided by](provided_by.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group) that provided it
    * range: [Agent](Agent.md)

### Inherited from gene to gene association:

 * [gene to gene association➞subject](gene_to_gene_association_subject.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: the subject gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md)
 * [gene to gene association➞object](gene_to_gene_association_object.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: the object gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa
    * range: [GeneOrGeneProduct](GeneOrGeneProduct.md)

### Domain for slot:

 * [gene to gene homology association➞relation](gene_to_gene_homology_association_relation.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: homology relationship type
    * range: [Uriorcurie](types/Uriorcurie.md)
