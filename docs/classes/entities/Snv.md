## Parents

 *  is_a: [SequenceVariant](SequenceVariant.md) - An allele that varies in its sequence from what is considered the reference allele at that locus.

## Attributes


### Inherited from gene product:

 * [id](id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A unique identifier for a thing. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [name](name.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * Description: A human-readable name for a thing
    * range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)

### Inherited from named thing:

 * [category](category.md)  <sub>1..*</sub>
    * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `bl:Protein`, `bl:GeneProduct`, `bl:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {bl:GenomicEntity, bl:MolecularEntity, bl:NamedThing}
    * range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)

### Inherited from sequence variant:

 * [sequence variant➞has gene](sequence_variant_has_gene.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: Each allele can be associated with any number of genes
    * range: [Gene](Gene.md)
 * [sequence variant➞has biological sequence](sequence_variant_has_biological_sequence.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: The state of the sequence w.r.t a reference sequence
    * range: [BiologicalSequence](types/BiologicalSequence.md)
 * [sequence variant➞id](sequence_variant_id.md)  <sub>REQ</sub>
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
    * Example:    
    * Example:    

### Inherited from thing with taxon:

 * [in taxon](in_taxon.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: connects a thing to a class representing a taxon
    * range: [OrganismTaxon](OrganismTaxon.md)
    * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
